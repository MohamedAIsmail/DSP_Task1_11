# Sampling-Studio


## Web Appilcation - Made using streamlit - Written in Python
A user friendly responsive website used for signal recovery process and creation of signal using many cool features and a neat design.


---


## Features
Our project has 2 main functions, **Signal plotting and signal composing**.

As a **User** you can

- Upload any signal from CSV file and plot it
- Add noise to the uploaded signal with an SNR (signal to noise ratio)
- Reconstruct your final product using whittaker-shannon interploation formula.

- Generate sinusoidal wave by adding its frequency and amplitude
- Add signals on each other and download the final added signal
- Choose a specific signal to remove from the summation of signals
